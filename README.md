# Rick.sh
## Video demonstration is available at `https://micahnotscottish.github.io/portfolio/projects`
This is a bash script I made, that after being run once, will embed itself in the file system
and continuously interact with the bash terminal, rick rolling the user after every input.
The script is self-modifying and self-migrating to make easy deletion more difficult.

To Run:
- Download both files and place in the same directory
- Run `./rick.sh`
